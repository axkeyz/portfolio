## The purpose

A site rebuild for The Handyman Group. This was one of the first few sites I built at Website Angels.

## The tech

SASS, PHP

## The learning

I didn't learn much. I had some fun loading buttons alongside the PDF using PDF.js: https://www.handymangroup.co.nz/handyman-franchise-brochure

The sliders on the blog were also a bit tricky with the (amount of unnecessary) default sitebuilder css. I still don't know why nobody uses grid at this company.
