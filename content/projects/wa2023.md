## The purpose

Replacement for Website Angel's main site.

## The learning

This was the first site I built for Website Angels (it has since changed quite a bit, like the logos). It was originally a clone of [a site built in 2021 with a legacy system](https://www.wad.co.nz/wa2021/) but in the newer system (yes, the systems are not very compatible).

I had no knowledge of SASS or their inhouse CMS at this point, but I found it pretty easy to learn.
