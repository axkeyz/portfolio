*The former company website was using Wordpress, but this has now been stripped in favour of a static site. The e-commerce site remains at https://techtraders.co.nz/*

## PURPOSE

The company website (that used to use Wordpress) was designed with Elementor Pro by the design agency. Eventually we didn't want to use Elementor Pro because the site would be broken almost every time there was an update, so we ended up stripping it for Gutenberg.

The e-commerce website was originally created in Shopify, but we switched to Wordpress with Woocommerce after the marketing specialist convinced us to do so. It also helped to keep the skillset consistent (PHP).

I was not involved in the design, mostly in the functionalities.

## TECH

Wordpress, with Gutenberg editor and Woocommerce.

## CONTRIBUTIONS

- Converted Elementor pages to Gutenberg
- Investigated suitable plugins and conflicts. Ideally plugins were free
- Ensured the plugins worked as expected and overrided any that didn't completely work as needed (Xero, Genoapay, etc.)
- Wrote a custom pricing plugin to combine functionalities of multiple plugins (reduce the total number of plugins) and avoid conflict

## LEARNING

- How Elementor and Gutenberg works
- Wordpress' action/filter hook cycle
- Overriding other plugins
- Wrote a custom plugin

## TODOS

Not at the moment, but may change in the future.
