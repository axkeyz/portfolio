draft: false

description: "A selection of my web and app projects. I developed these with clarity, utility, speed and/or fun in mind. Contact me for your next project today."

comments: "Most of the projects here are from work or stuff I wrote in my spare time to automate work. I'm a bit lazy with other pet projects - game dev has my interest, but I still don't know what kind of game I want to make after almost a year. But anyway..."


completed: Completed, or mostly completed. The barebones exist, but I may upgrade stuff later, whether it be refactoring, adding more features and missing tests, or making stuff look a bit better.

planned: In progress, or simply planned. The ideas exist, but the time doesn't. Wish I had more time.
