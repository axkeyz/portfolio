draft: false

description: "A selection of my web and app projects. I developed these with clarity, utility, speed and/or fun in mind. Contact me for your next project today."

comments: "...I actually struggle a bit with finding time for non-work projects. Going back to university to study engineering was not exactly the best idea to free up my spare time and I would rather spend the limited time doing game dev."


completed: Completed, or mostly completed. The barebones exist, but I may upgrade stuff later, whether it be refactoring, adding more features and missing tests, or making stuff look a bit better.

planned: In progress, or simply planned. The ideas exist, but the time doesn't. Wish I had more time.
