draft: false

description: A selection of my web and app projects. I developed these with clarity, utility, or work in mind. View my previous projects.

comments: "Most of the projects here are from work or stuff I wrote in my spare time to automate work. I'm a bit lazy with other pet projects - game dev has my interest, but I still don't know what kind of game I want to make after almost a year. But anyway..."

planned: In progress, or simply planned. The ideas exist, but the time doesn't. Wish I had more time.
