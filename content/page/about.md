I'm Aileen Huang, a full-stack developer based in Auckland, New Zealand.

I build APIs, apps and websites with various languages and tools. I've designed UIs and made various graphics for several of them too, but I must admit that despite good reviews, designing graphic stuff doesn't come too intuitively for me. So sad.

I've always had a great interest in coding, and somehow ended up doing all sorts of development at my current job despite being hired for something else (accounts assistance). Granted, I still do what I was hired for...if my automations can't do it in my place.

I usually code under the name, axkeyz, which is based off "Axis Key", a name I used to use for a certain game I used to play. I don't use "Axis Key" much these days, but a, x and k remain common to my online handles.

When I'm not coding, I usually read web novels, listen to music, idle an idle game or write bad poetry.
