I have rethemed my website for the nth time. I just can't decide on what I want on my website and what would be the best kind of styling. This one is hopefully better though.<!--more--> 

Definitely not satisfied. It's still missing the dark mode for one. The design is still kind of bad (this is why I'm not a graphic designer and I admire them a heck ton). Will get onto that another day.

I've been thinking of retheming for a while. I'll probably try a sci-fi futuristic one.

Anyway, the main purpose of this retheme is to start sharing my endeavours into become a better programmer. 

At some point, I just realised that my current job is mind numbingly boring and won't make me a better programmer in the long run. I also really want to do software development (app development) rather than building cookie cutter websites. I want to be a well rounded programmer who can undertake challenging and innovative work one day.

Although I can write fairly clean code, refactor it somewhat well (I did read Clean Code), it would be helpful to gain deeper insight into how things actually work under the hood instead of relying on intuition and what other people write.

And to do that, I need to know more about computer science.

The first book I plan to read is Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective. This isn't the first book I've read on programming, and it definitely won't be the last. I've started reading this already, and have some notes on each chapter that I will be uploading over time.
