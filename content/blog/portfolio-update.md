In 2023, I plan to return to the workforce. Ideally, I'd like to relocate to Hamilton, but staying in Auckland is possible too. There are a couple of reasons, but it is mainly due to a change of circumstances. Hence, I finally updated my portfolio. There's still a lot that can be added, but it should be on its way over time.<!--more-->

## BACKGROUND

In 2021, I returned to study at engineering at UoA. I always wanted to study software or mechanical engineering, or at the very least computer science, but I grew up listening to my mother who absolutely did not want me to study either. The reason? Because, "you're a girl". 

That sentence is the bane of my existence.

I've heard it throughout my life. I gave up my interest in rocks, trains and space from a young age. I gave up swimming for it barely out of my teens. I grew up listening about my future kids, that I personally think I will never want. And then, I studied something I wasn't too interested in.

My first time messing around with code was probably year 7 in the computer labs. I attended all the coding workshops there were (it was a game dev workshop to recreate Flappy Bird). There was no computer science available (all-girls school, sigh), but I would've really liked to study that if it had been offered.

However, I only realised I wanted to study engineering or something computer related by year 10, or the age where you have to fill in a ton of "career surveys". And that was the time when all I could do was dump puzzle solutions written in Python on Pastebin. But my mother refused to let me do so, and so I wrote less code. I became increasingly withdrawn and disinterested in most things because I had pretty much given up everything I ever had an interest in.

I studied food science. I absolutely hated it. But my mother refused to let me change majors. Thankfully my grades were good enough to add an international business major. That was probably the most interesting part of the degree.

### Working

I didn't care for food science related jobs and somehow I ended up doing accounts assistance. It was mind numbingly boring, so I decided to write an automation tool. While writing it, the technical head realised that I had an interest in writing code and got me working on the Wordpress website.

Fast forward to a year later, I continued to do accounts assistance (mostly automated) and worked on the main company website, e-commerce website, client portal and some other apps/tools.

My mother finally realised that I writing code was one of the only things that made me happy (well, other than food + sleep). This time, she let me do whatever I wanted.

### Going back to study

I went back to study engineering. I really wanted to know what my life would've been like if I had followed my original wishes. And I know if I never tried, I would regret it for life. It being Covid times, plus reduced wages/hours at Divers, gave me the push to finally go for it.

If I had followed my original wishes, I probably would've studied software or mechanical engineering. I didn't go for software in the end because I wanted to try something different. I didn't pick mechanical due to fluid flows reminding me of food science. I went for civil, which funnily had fluid flows, but I also got to see rocks & soils.

I got to study stuff I wanted to at some point, but my conclusion is, website/software remains my #1.

## NEW CIRCUMSTANCES

I'd like to return to the workforce. There's a couple of reasons.
- Coding makes me happy. I'm not coding enough these days.
- I need more time. I'd really like to do more game development. I'd like to finish off my water dashboard. Studying is taking up way too much time.
- I am absolutely certain that I want to do software development so there doesn't seem to be much point in studying civil engineering. I may take up a postgrad certificate instead if not having a degree will hold me back that much.
- My sister will be away in Hamilton for a minimum of 1 year. I'd like to go with her.
- My family's finances aren't looking too good...
