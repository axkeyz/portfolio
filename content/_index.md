b1_description:
    - I code to speed up the boring parts of my job and tasks my family finds boring. That gives me a bit of time to make the interesting stuff (games & websites).
    - More or less a full stack developer minus design. Can't design, but can appreciate a good one. Hopefully, that includes this site.

    - My skill points are a bit stacked on PHP and Python, but I'm kinda open to anything.

b4_heading: Site is fast and elegant... but so boring.
b4_description:
    - Perhaps you agree that this site loads fast, but the design isn't quite interesting enough. Maybe you think it needs more images, more animations, more fun.
    - Perhaps try my former landing pages. Similar content, but different style. All of them load blazing quick.
b4_tabs:
    - Animated SVGs:
        - /img/500h_placeholder.png
        - /svg-landing
        - With a ton of words, svgs and fancy scroll animations. Progressive web-app style.
    - Animated Photos:
        - /img/500h_placeholder.png
        - /photo-landing
        - With a ton of photos and fancy scroll animations. Progressive web-app style.
    - Photographic WP:
        - /img/500h_placeholder.png
        - https://wpdev.aileenhuang.dev
        - With a ton of photos, fancy scroll animations. Wordpress style.
